# Healthyopedia
Though we have an advancement in technology the count of people suffering from various health issues havenâ€™t reduced. 
We can observe unhealthiness in people at a very young age due to the lack of health management. 
The project aims at developing a full stack website that would help the people to monitor their health to live a healthy life.
The project is built using React JS and Django. React JS is used to create the frontend of the website and Django is used for server-side programming i.e., for creating the backend of the website. 
The key features of the website include online consultation, sales of generic medicine, current health news and tips, Symptom predictor and remedies, hospital details, user health repository etc. 
It is a freely accessible website that provides various health benefits to the users for the maintenance of their health
